      <p>To become a partner, prepare a short “letter of intent” expressing your entity’s interest in PREP, your intended workgroup, and how you meet the partner criteria.

      <ul>
        <li>A commitment to the PREP mission.</li>
        <li>A commitment to contribute to the Partnership{"'"}s mission through in-kind or direct contribution (e.g. engagement, data, platform).</li>
        <li>Delegation of at least one person to be the point of contact who is actively involved as needed.</li>
      </ul>
