          <p>The PREP Platform is a project started by the Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP), a public-private collaboration that emerged out of the White House Climate Data Initiative. We aim to facilitate collaboration among technology innovators, researchers, data scientists, and practitioners from the private sector, civil society and government. This cooperation will help spur new types of data discovery; develop innovative, customizable tools in response to user needs; and facilitate sharing and collective learning.</p>
